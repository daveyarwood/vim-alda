*alda.txt*	A Vim plugin for editing and playing Alda scores.

INTRODUCTION						*alda-introduction*

Alda is a music programming language designed for musicians who don't
necessarily know how to program, as well as programmers who don't necessarily
know how to music.

For more information on Alda itself:

	http://github.com/alda-lang/alda

This plugin provides a nice environment for Vim users to work on Alda scores.

INDENTATION					*ft-alda-indent* *alda-indent*

(not yet implemented)

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING				*ft-alda-syntax* *alda-syntax*

Syntax highlighting is provided.

NAVIGATION					*ft-alda-sections* *alda-sections*
					    *ft-alda-navigation* *alda-navigation*

Special behavior for Vim |object-motions| is provided.

|[[| and |]]| navigate to the previous/next top-level thing, which could be an
instrument part, Clojure expression, variable definition, or comment block.

(A "top-level thing" here is any block of text starting with a non-whitespace
character, either at the top of the file or following an empty line.)

|[]| and |][| navigate between instrument parts, specifically. For this to
work properly, you must follow the convention of starting each instrument part
at the beginning of a line (no leading whitespace), and break the line after
the colon, e.g.:
>
	piano:
	  c d e f g

	clarinet:
	  e f g a b

FOLDING						*ft-alda-folding* *alda-folding*

(not yet implemented)

Alda instrument parts and voices are foldable using the standard Vim
|fold-commands|.
